(2-24-12) GA implementation for computing delta done. Recovery needs to be done, as well as some sort of optimization (if possible) extra latency from GA? Currently reads from an on disk file, but should be easy to switch this over to reading from in-memory buffer.
(2-24-12) Time to work on this finally. Added more of the infrastructure for the GA, seems to be a matter of implementing now
(2-20-12) Abandon p-thread model in favor of GA. Recovery from delta implemented although will double check both forward/backward operations for validity. Beginning work on GA implementation that will go with nwchem
(2-11-12) Initial delta implementation in place, benchmarking a little more general, pthreading beginning to be added to delta program.
(1-27-12) Added things to correct dataset, working on delta
(1-24-12) Added various scripts/binaries made so far
